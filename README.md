##ICARUS BOT
This is a very simple IRC bot that I built from scratch because I wanted to
learn about [RFC2812](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812).

This is a WIP and sux real bad, dealwithit.

##Usage:
 - Copy config.dist.json to config.json
 - Fill out all the stuff in config.json
 - `node index.js`
 - Currently supports a !face command that fetches a random face [from my
   smiley face api](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lysergix-api)
